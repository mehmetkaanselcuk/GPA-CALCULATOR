# GPA-CALCULATOR
This program calculates the GPA (Grade Point Average) based on the user's input grades. If the calculated GPA is higher than 60, the program displays "Pass" to indicate success. If the GPA is 60 or lower, it displays "Fail" to indicate failure. This way, the user can easily understand their academic status based on the overall average
You can access the main entry point of the project from Baslangic.java located in the src/Giris directory.
